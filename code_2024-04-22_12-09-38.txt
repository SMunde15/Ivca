```java
public class HelloWorld {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  }
}

**Explanation:**

*   **public class HelloWorld:** This line declares a public class named HelloWorld. In Java, every application must have at least one class, and the class name should match the file name (HelloWorld.java).
*   **public static void main(String[] args):** This line defines the main method, which is the entry point of any Java application. The `public` keyword makes it accessible from anywhere, `static` allows it to be called without creating an instance of the class, `void` means it doesn't return any value, and `main` is the specific name that the Java runtime looks for when starting a program. The `String[] args` parameter is an array of strings that can be used to pass command-line arguments to the program.
*   **System.out.println("Hello, world!"):** This line prints the string "Hello, world!" to the console. `System.out` is a standard output stream, and `println` is a method that prints
